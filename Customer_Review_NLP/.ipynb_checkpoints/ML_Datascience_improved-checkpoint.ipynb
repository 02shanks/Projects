Nor a young girl whose mind is clearly gone, an old man in need of care himself (and doesn&#8217;t quite seem all there in Olivia&#8217;s opinion). Furthermore, Marion Dunraven, the only sane one of the bunch and the one Olivia is inexplicable drawn to, seems captive to everyone in the dusty old house. More importantly, she doesn't expect to fall in love with Dunraven's daughter Marion.Can Olivia truly believe the stories of sadness and death that surround the house, or are they all just local neighborhood rumor?Was that carriage trouble just a coincidence or a supernatural sign to stay away? If she remains, will the Castle&#8217;s dark shadows take Olivia down with them or will she and Marion long enough to declare their love?Patty G. Henderson has created an atmospheric and intriguing story in her Gothic tale. I found this to be an enjoyable read, even if it isn&#8217;t my usual preferred genre. I think, with this tale, I got hooked on the old Gothic romantic style. So I think fans of the genre (and of lesbian romances) will enjoy it.\""

The other part of this book is a history of the man himself, his work and his life.  Which is very interesting and has some great points to consider as well.  While the book might help change some lives, at my age and current stage of life it's partly irrelevant.  Although many of his philosophies do apply in some way to my life, and some of the suggestions/orders will leak through the crust and affect my behavior.  I was actually surprised to find how close my standards are to his, minus the physical regimen, with never having been in the military.A good book and a good read.\n"
